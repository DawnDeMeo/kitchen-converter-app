add more categories - fetched automatically from db, so add new ingredients to naturally bring in more categories

  When you do add more default ingredients and categories, a few things to keep in mind:

  - Consistency - Settle on a naming convention (e.g., "Baking & Spices" vs "Baking and Spices")
  - Breadth - Categories that are too narrow create clutter; too broad and they lose usefulness
  - Coverage - Ensure common ingredients have logical homes (though "Other" is a perfectly fine
  catch-all)
