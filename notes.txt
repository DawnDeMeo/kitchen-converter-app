icon - outline of kitchen scale?

think of changing name of app

contact info

companion website?

add notes to .gitignore

clock to Abc causes buttons to jump. need same size - can constraint to button size be added?

convert screen should show category

consider custom keyboard (new branch)
decimal plus slash, and fractions on top

from and to - segmented picker for wt/vol? or division in drop down? want to avoid scrolling. but keep in mind some are units

alternative ideas from convert screen - more compact? don't like that results are so far down

improve convert and settings screens so they work well on ipad too, maybe navstack instead of sheet?


----
* test main screen with custom, favorite
* new ingredient, add conversion, keyboard accessory
* converted value
* settings

* active yeast won't convert from cup to grams, or even tsp to grams, but will convert grams to tsp. database provides tablespoon to gram, should be able to calculate that a teaspoon is 1/3 tablespoon. same for 1 cup. gram to cup works, not cup to gram. should know a cup is 16 tablespoons
* in dark mode, S&P now has white text on light gray bg, still not contrasty enough...black text on active part of segment only?

manual updates
* updated preview in IngredientListView to include category and another custom example
* updated IngredientRow to move custom tag after category tag
* pulled VStack from IngredientListView to new IngredientRowView, called from IngredientListView and ConversionView. now tagging looks more consistent and code isn't duplicated
* in ConversionView results equal sign was centered, but no from or to amounts. removed spacers around equal sign, then changed VStack alignment to .center instead
